<perf_description><![CDATA[The legendary indie rock band, which got its start in 1983, emerged in the 1980s with a series of lo-fi records and made a splash in the big leagues with its albums on TVT and Matador, including "Isolation Drills" and 'Half Smiles of the Decomposed." In 2014, after the release of "Cool Planet," the group disbanded, but in 2016, Pollard put together a new/old lineup; he brought in Bobby Bare Jr. on guitar, joined by previously ex-GBV guitarist (1997-2004) Doug Gillard, as well as drummer Kevin March (on his third go-round with the band) and new bassist Mark Shue. This lineup went on to record the album "Please Be Honest" later that year.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Chicago blues legend and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Buddy Guy, now in his early 80s, has established himself as one of the music world's premiere guitar players, having influenced musicians since the late '50s and paved the way for many blues players to follow in his footsteps. The Louisiana-born Guy started off with a makeshift guitar, which was made from a two-string contraption attached to a piece of wood and secured with his mother's hairpins. He later moved to Chicago and got the recognition he needed from Muddy Waters, joining his band and becoming a house guitarist at Chess Records. The rest, as they say, is history. A major influence on rock titans like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, a pioneer of Chicago's fabled West Side sound, and a living link to the city's halcyon days of electric blues, Guy has received seven Grammy Awards, a 2015 Lifetime Achievement Grammy, 34 Blues Music Awards (the most any artist has received), the Billboard Magazine Century Award for distinguished artistic achievement, a Kennedy Center Honor, and the Presidential National Medal of Arts. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him No. 23 in its "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time."]]></perf_description>

Their first single 'Rock Lobster,' recorded in 1978, was an underground success, and on the strength of their energetic, post-punk live shows at such legendary venues as CBGB in New York City and Max's Kansas City, their self-titled debut sold more than 500,000 copies. Now, more than 30 years and 20 million albums sold later, the group is still one of the most beloved party bands in existence. The touring band includes members Sterling Campbell, Paul Gordon and Tracy Wormworth.]]></perf_description>

The Yardbirds expanded the range of the electric guitar, experimenting with feedback, sustain and fuzztone. They were a bridge between the tributary white R&B of early-sixties London and the pastures of fuzz-toned psychedelia and power-chorded heavy metal that came later. Jim McCarty, the one remaining original member, fronts a new generation of the band. The lineup he put together in 2015 includes guitarist Johnny A, bassist Kenny Aaronson, singer/harpist/percussionist Myke Scavone and guitarist/singer John Idan.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[My Brightest Diamond is a chamber pop band spearheaded by singer/songwriter Shara Worden. After earning an opera degree at the University of North Texas, she moved to New York City to simultaneously continue her opera studies and pursue her songwriting ambitions, releasing two albums with her band Awry. After the breakup of Awry, Shara assembled a coterie of musicians to accompany her with bass and drums, strings, wine glasses and wind chimes, and thus the sound of My Brightest Diamond was formed. Shara's Mancini-esque string arrangements laced with dramatic guitars and punk rock drums define the Diamond sound. On stage she channels the vocal theatrics of Jeff Buckley, the soulful seductiveness of Nina Simone, and the gothic pop of Portishead. The band's second album is 'A Thousand Shark's Teeth,' released on Asthmatic Kitty Records.]]></perf_description>

He first came to prominence in the '80s with the psychedelic country-rock band Green on Red, recording eight albums and an EP with them before going solo in 1990. Following his muse to wherever it takes him sonically, he has released 14 albums of diverse styles. His latest, the rocker "Bobby Fuller Died for Your Sins," was released in early 2017. He calls it "California noir," and there's definitely a dark current running below or at surface, with such songs as the title tune, which references the star-crossed '60s rock legend, and "Bad Year for Rock and Roll," based on the morbid musical year that was 2016.]]></perf_description>

She began performing her songs in 2005, booking herself into a local gig in Bristol after being rejected by the Old Vic Theatre School. She eventually uploaded some of her songs to MySpace, where she earned the same type of notice as Lily Allen, who first scored a great deal of exposure in early 2006. Nash's first single was a vinyl only 7-inch of her song 'Caroline's a Victim.' She eventually signed with Fiction, which issued the single 'Foundations,' which spent five weeks on the UK Top-40, reaching number two in the summer of 2007. Her debut album, 'Made With Bricks,' arrived in August, reaching Number One on the UK album chart, selling over 60,000 copies.]]></perf_description>

In those days Roger, whose daytime job was in a sheet metal factory, even made the band's guitars, and it was his energy and ambition that drove the group during their formative years.

The characterization includes facial tics, unusually active eyebrows and a crooked smile. She also wears lipstick drawn beyond all natural borders and often dances stiffly to the music she is performing.

The album shot up the Billboard charts, where it landed atop the Bluegrass Chart and in the top 25 of the Heatseakers Chart. Influenced by the contradiction of their progressive home of Chapel Hill, North Carolina and the surrounding rural southern landscapes, "Old Time Reverie" dips in, explores and mixes the complexities of traditional bluegrass with modern instrumentation and smart pop melodies.  The result is a distinctly unique blend of modern-day Americana.]]></perf_description>

According to the New York Times, her performance of Odetta's "Water Boy, had "the fervor of a spiritual, the yips of a folk holler, and the sultry insinuation of the blues." She brought the audience to its feet. Many concert goers were unfamiliar with her Grammy Award-winning work as a member of African-American folk interpreters Carolina Chocolate Drops, her elegant bearing, prodigious voice, and fierce spirit. She performed for President Obama and the First Lady on "A White House Tribute to Gospel," along with Aretha Franklin and Emmylou Harris; the program was televised on PBS. She dueted with country superstar Eric Church on his powerful anti-racism song "Kill a Word;" the two have performed the song on "The Tonight Show" and the CMA Awards, among other programs. Giddens received the BBC Radio 2 Folk Award for Singer of the Year and has won the Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Bluegrass and Banjo in 2016.]]></perf_description>

The original idea for the musical direction was to remain high-energy, while allowing melodies and harmonies to be a prominent feature, rather than just screaming to portray intense emotion. The group has stretched its creative legs through extensive touring and has allowed itself to write parts and songs that were much more heavily influenced by jazz, funk, blues, fusion, and Latin musical styles.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Moon Boots is a dubstep and drum-and-bass music remixer. He entered the world in the mid-1980s via Cape Canaveral. After years of service as the preferred footwear of celebrity astronauts (notably Tom Hanks), Moon Boots came to life during a classified experiment aboard the International Space Station. Little is known of what actually transpired aboard the shuttle, but in short, Moon Boots became a sentient creature, equipped with reason, intuition and groove. Before long, he grew tired of working for the space-military-industrial complex and found solace in the soothing sounds of underground disco and R&B boogie records. He knew it was only of matter of time before he was hung up like so many boots before him. He abandoned the program and used his savings to build a studio in an unnamed location, where he is currently working.]]></perf_description>

The resulting track, the epic "You're The One For Me" - and its memorable ‘sexy sandwich' video of a girl getting inventive with her baguette fillings - triggered internet pandemonium and placed the duo firmly at the top of 2014's New Artists To Watch lists. So remarkable was it that the song also swiped the #1 spot on Hype Machine twice in one month. The duo features singer/songwriter Jon Sandler and multi-instrumentalist/producer Luke Moellman.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Nimrud. Aleppo. Palmyra. Ebla. These ancient sites and many others in Iraq and Syria have found their way to the top of international news today, as the destruction of cultural heritage becomes both a by-product and a tactic of ongoing war. This new exhibition, created in conjunction with the Penn Cultural Heritage Center, sheds light on the ongoing destruction of cultural heritage in the Middle East by showing what's at stake- the rich history of the region and the diversity of its people-and what's being done to prevent the loss of this history and cultural identity.  Fascinating ancient art and artifacts from the Penn Museum's extensive Near East collection tell stories of the cultures of Syria and Iraq through time. Contemporary artwork from Issam Kourbaj, a Syrian artist based in Cambridge, UK, provides an art intervention-a modern-day response to the artifacts and themes. The exhibition features the important work being done by the University of Pennsylvania and Smithsonian Institution in conjunction with individuals and groups in the Middle East to help combat the loss of irreplaceable cultural heritage.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[English playwright William Congreve said in 1695, "...I have never made any observation of what I apprehend to be true humor in women..." Possibly the first person to say women aren't funny, Congreve probably didn't know any better because he was born too early to catch a Really Funny Comedians (Who Happen to Be Women) show. San Francisco's vibrant comedy scene produced Margaret Cho, Paula Poundstone, Aisha Tyler and recent rising stars Ali Wong and Emily Heller. See the latest crop of up-and-coming funny ladies. Congreve stands corrected. (Actually, being long dead, he doesn't stand at all.)]]></perf_description>

Coach Nicolás' team plays in a Havana neighborhood that is rich in community but struggling economically, while Coach Roscoe's plays in Ghost Town, a troubled Oakland neighborhood wracked by three decades of gang violence.

<perf_name><![CDATA[The Michael Allman Band]]></perf_name>
<perf_description><![CDATA[Michael Allman is the 1st born son of legendary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member of the Allman Brothers, Greg Allman. Michael's bluesy soulful voice and look is very reminiscent of his father in his prime! Michael has shared the stage with many well-known artists through the years and continues to put smiles on the faces of his fans every time he gets on stage and starts belting out the sounds. "Hard Labor Creek" - If Michael's evocative singing was the only attraction on Michael Allman's Hard Labor Creek, it would still be worth hearing, but there is a lot more going on than that. Some of the most gifted musicians in Georgia, from young slide guitar phenom Tony Tyler to Motown alumnus and keyboard legend Ike Stubblefield, contribute to the overall sound of this remarkable record. Tyler's slide and keyboard work are an essential part of the sound of Hard Labor Creek, adding just the right touch without overpowering the song. Stubblefield kicks serious butt here, showing why he is a first-call session player, and his production contribution is one reason this CD sounds so darn good. Soulful backing vocals by Atlanta local favorite Diane Durrett and percussion from Derek Trucks Band drummer Yonrico Scott flesh out the songs. The one and only Col. Bruce Hampton also makes a memorable cameo appearance. While Michael Allman's Hard Labor Creek stands on its own merits, he isn't ashamed of his heritage, and there are several references to his famous father. "Laid Back" written by Sonny Tackett, was inspired by Gregg's classic album of the same name. "If Dreams Were Money" was actually written for Gregg years ago by veteran Boston musician Bruce Marshall. Still, the spotlight is firmly on Michael, who wrote four of the songs on the CD, and delivers each tune with the kind of thoughtful approach that squeezes the inner meaning out of every word. The lyrics in songs like "Running Alone Again", "It Ain't Me" and "Circus Full of Clowns" address universal topics like love and loss in a way that any listener can relate to.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[InLiquid and Park Towne Place present "Configuration," an exhibition of ceramic sculptures by Nicholas Kripal. Inspired by tools and objects from everyday life, such as hand tools and baking molds, Kripal made sculptures combining these forms into symmetrical clusters and stacks, altering in color and shifting in scale. In creating artwork from common forms, Kripal celebrated humble handywork, elevating the ordinary into something to be revered. "Configuration" will display a collection of these works, which together tell a story of a time and place through objects.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[John Malkovich defies heaven and earth in a one-man journey to the point where power corrupts absolutely.   A dictator teeters on the brink, and megalomania escalates into full-blown madness. John Malkovich stands against the sound of the mighty organ in this astonishing music-drama: an exploration of tyranny in the raw by an actor of unparalleled conviction. From Nero to Idi Amin, despots have had megalomaniac delusions of divine provenance. Michael Sturminger's music-theatre piece pits Malkovich against the grandiloquent power of the organ. Organist Martin Haselböck responds with music by Bach, Wagner, Liszt: words against music, genius versus delusion, and at its terrifying heart, an actor who spares no-one - least of all himself. ]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, the core members of Steely Dan, met at Bard College in 1967 and together formed the Steely Dan in 1971. Through the '70s, they recorded eight albums, hitting #3 on Billboard's Top 200 with 1978s "Aja." All told, they have an astounding four-decade catalog that includes hits like "Reelin' in the Years" and "Rikki Don't Lose That Number."    The Doobie Brothers are pioneers of the California rock 'n' roll sound of the '70s. Formed in Oakland, the band evolved from a mellow, post-hippie boogie band to a slick, soul-inflected pop band by the end of the decade. Along the way, they racked up a string of gold and platinum albums, along with a number of radio hits such as "Listen to the Music," "Black Water" and "China Grove."]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[A needle's eye in a pond, a Greek temple in the garden, an Ottoman tent sitting on a hill--these are just a few of the inspirations for Winterthur's upcoming, first-ever outdoor exhibition Follies: Architectural Whimsy in the Garden! The exhibition showcases whimsical and classic garden structures located throughout the Winterthur estate. Follies are architectural constructions, often extravagant or picturesque, positioned within the landscape to amuse, frame a view, or pique your curiosity. You may have seen follies at other estates or in television shows or movies, such as Downton Abbey or Brideshead Revisited. Henry Francis du Pont, who developed Winterthur's expansive gardens from 1902 to 1969, was familiar with follies throughout America and Europe and incorporated several into his own garden plans. Some of the follies you will see in the exhibition were created or procured by H.F. du Pont as he developed the garden. Others are newly built structures inspired by follies at other estates. Together they offer a fresh and delightful way for visitors to experience Winterthur's sweeping vistas, quiet corners, and winding paths.  The exhibit can be enjoyed on foot or from the garden tram. The walking loop takes approximately 45 minutes at a leisurely pace. The main path through the garden is wheelchair and stroller accessible.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Co-organized with the Roswell Museum and Art Center in New Mexico, Magical & Real is the first joint retrospective of Wyeth and Hurd's work since 1967, and the first scholarly exhibition to seriously consider the work of either artist in thirty years. The exhibition re-situates Hurd and Wyeth into the larger dialogue of American art in the 20th century, with the aim of broadening awareness of the entire scope of their work while grappling with the tensions that exist between the eastern and western arts communities. It will also reintroduce audiences familiar only with the name Wyeth to the significant body of work produced by the woman that Andrew Wyeth felt was the most talented of all N.C. Wyeth's children. Accompanied by a richly illustrated scholarly catalogue with essays by Jensen and Woodbury, Magical & Real will include approximately 70 paintings, augmented by video and audio recordings not yet seen or heard in public, that document their lives and careers.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[The Soul Survivors have been a favorite in this region since their early start in the 1950s, and we're happy to see them returning! Brothers Charlie and Richie developed their signature vocal style while playing in Atlantic City and quickly moved on to Philadelphia. It was after fast success in Philly that their mega hit "Expressway To Your Heart" was written and climbed to #4 on the Top 100 chart. Following the huge hit, The Soul Survivors toured extensively with the likes of The Beach Boys, Janis Joplin and Sly and The Family Stone. Join Charlie and his band for an evening of 60s classics!]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Congregation Shivtei Yeshuron-Ezras Israel, the Little Shul, looks forward to welcoming back the Katz Center for Advanced Jewish Studies and fellow Dr. Yossi Chajes from the University of Haifa who will speak on "Kabbalah as a Science" on Thursday, April 19 at 7:00 PM.   Free and open to the public! Refreshments served. In the medieval and early modern periods, Kabbalah was understood as a kind of science, revealing the hidden workings of the divine in the cosmos. This talk will provide an overview of this perspective on the Jewish mystical tradition, and look closely at some fascinating sources in which kabbalists (and others) speak about their lore as a science. J. H. (Yossi) Chajes is the director of the Center for the Study of Jewish Cultures and an associate professor of Jewish history, both at the University of Haifa. His research interests include kabbalah, early modern Jewish egodocuments, women's religiosity, the history of Jewish attitudes toward magic, and the visualization of knowledge. He is currently directing the Israel Science Foundation-supported Ilanot Project, which is working to catalog and describe all kabbalistic cosmological diagrams.  Please RSVP at https://www.eventbrite.com/e/kabbalah-as-a-science-registration-42096652220.

<perf_name><![CDATA[Best Buddies Friendship Walk: Philadelphia]]></perf_name>
<perf_description><![CDATA[The Best Buddies Friendship Walk (BBFW) is the number one walk in the country raising awareness and funds to support individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The walk plays a key role in funding Best Buddies programs dedicated to one-to-one friendships, leadership development, and integrated job opportunities for individuals with IDD. Each walk provides an opportunity to see the Best Buddies mission in action at a local level. Proceeds from the Best Buddies Friendship Walk provide the necessary tools for people with IDD to become more independent and valued members of our society. Since the walk's inception in 2009, more than 70,000 participants in 46 cities have walked to raise awareness for inclusion, friendship, leadership, and opportunity for people with IDD. We're thrilled to bring our annual Friendship Walk to the King of Prussia Mall this spring and hope you'll join us for an epic celebration of friendship and inclusion!]]></perf_description>

<perf_name><![CDATA[Elizabeth Osborne: Animal Paintings & Watercolors]]></perf_name>
<perf_description><![CDATA[One of Philadelphia's most respected artists, Elizabeth Osborne (born 1936) is often drawn to the beauty and special personalities of household pets: dogs, cats, and other animals. Two recent, large-scale paintings and numerous watercolors anchor this intimate exhibition, exploring a charming, lesser-known side of Osborne's practice. With a career spanning over fifty years, Osborne's body of work has been the subject of important critical study. She is well known for her figurative paintings of the 1960 and 70s as well as her current assemblage and color spectrum abstract compositions that blur the distinction between abstraction and representation. Osborne's work is included in the collections of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Delaware Art Museum, the James A. Michener Museum of Art, the Woodmere Art Museum, the State Museum of Pennsylvania, and in many private collections. She has had solo exhibitions at the James A. Michener Art Museum, the Delaware Art Museum, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and Locks Gallery.]]></perf_description>

Pull up a chair to the timeless music of The Midnight Society playing everything from Fats Waller to Bing Croasby spanning the 1910's, 20's, 30's and 40's in music. With bottomless mimosas, incredible brunch items that bridge the gap between freshly smoked barbecue and breakfast classics what more can one ask for, you ask? Well, how about an interactive and ever-rotating cast of different performers that range from burlesque to comedy to sideshow.

The adjectives ‘prolific' and ‘eclectic' frequently pop up in Rik's profiles, after five decades in the biz. Following over a dozen platinum albums from his Triumph years, he produced 19 more as an indie, ranging from rock to blues to jazz to folk to classical. International notoriety earned him entry into three Canadian Halls of Fame, a star on the Walk of Fame in his hometown of Mississauga, and he picked up a few ‘Best Guitarist' awards in various style categories from different organizations along the way. Author of a GUITAR PLAYER magazine column for over a dozen years, the resulting compilation instruction book, "For The Love of Guitar", recently landed at #4 in Shawn Persinger's review of "The 50 Greatest Guitar Books". As a music educator, Mr. E. remains humbly proud of his long-standing inclusion on the heavily-respected Humber College faculty, where he's taught Songwriting, Music Business and Directed Studies; and he's also been Artistic Director of the Songstudio Songwriting Workshop every summer for the past 12 years. This show will be an acoustic duo performance with Dave Dunlop.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Pack your lunch and join us for our lecture series that explores cultural and historical moments through the Jewish lens. " 2,000 Years of Jewish History Through Synagogue Architecture," April 24. Throughout the history of the Jewish people, synagogue architecture has varied over the centuries since the destruction of the Temple and the Jewish diaspora. Ironically, synagogues lacked a defined architectural style until 1959 when famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed Beth Sholom Congregation in suburban Philadelphia. Barbara Cohen, ASID, President of the Schuylkill River Heritage Center, will trace the history of the Jewish people through the architecture of synagogues and discuss the many stylistic adaptations synagogues adopted in relation to the place, time, and world events during construction.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[On this day, we will receive a transmission of the main points that were given at the NKT International Festival in England earlier in the week. Emptiness is not nothingness, but is the real way in which things exist. Buddha taught all of our problems come from not understanding the true nature of things. He said that all of his teachings were actually methods to realize emptiness, the true nature of all phenomena. When we realize emptiness all our suffering will permanently cease, in the same way in which when we awaken from a dream, all suffering from the dream simply disappears. We will receive teachings and be guided in practical meditations on emptiness. These will help us to have a clear understanding of emptiness that we can use to relax our mind, see people in a more positive light, and ultimately attain the lasting happiness of enlightenment. Taught by Resident Teacher, Gen Tenzin. Everyone is welcome.    Schedule:  10:00-11:00am  12:00-1:00pm  3:00-4:00pm  5:00-6:00pm]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Much Ado About Nothing by William Shakespeare. Directed by James Ijames. Mischief and merriment abound in Shakespeare's battle of the sexes. Don Pedro's army may have succeeded in their skirmishes, but in Messina, an idyllic country estate, conflicts of the heart prove much more trying. As young Claudio and Hero fall madly in love, and Benedick and Beatrice reignite their combative courtship, we quickly see how love can bring out the best - and the worst - in all of us.  In a whirl of masquerade balls, mistaken identities, Much Ado About Nothing offers intrigue, passion, and adventure.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[A blues spin on Beatles classics. Blues Beatles started during the breaks of the rehearsals of Today, their original band. Marcos, the singer, would pick up his guitar and start playing Beatles songs. The other members of the band were amazed at how natural the songs sounded and being blues players, the rest of the band started adding their blues twist to these "break songs." One day they finally said 'why don't we mix these two things we love to play?' Most of the vocal melodies are kept in their original form, but interpreted with Marcos Viana's unique voice, in an unpretentious and heart felt way. The arrangements combine blues and soul grooves that suit the vocals of the songs while adding a different feel to them. Instrumental solos and improvisation, typical elements of the blues, are an integral part of the Blues Beatles style. Their fiery live performances showcase their individual and collective skills as soloists. This is something you've got to see live, and this is your first chance to see them in Sellersville!]]></perf_description>

This exhibition places the work of Andrew Wyeth and John Ruskin together for the first time, examining their varying approaches to interpreting the natural world.Andrew Wyeth was the youngest in a family of five children, the son of renowned illustrator, N.C. Wyeth, who recognized his talent and encouraged him to develop his skill. John Ruskin, the only child in a rising middle-class family, was encouraged to make drawings from nature. As a respected art critic, he became the spokesperson for art of the modern era in Britain and the champion of the artists of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Enjoy the sights, sounds, smells, and tastes of the region, past and present, during this two-day festival to mark the opening of the Middle East Galleries!  Saturday begins with a ribbon cutting ceremony at 11 am. There's a puppet show with scenes from the Epic of Gilgamesh and a children's story time with Middle Eastern tales; ancient cuneiform tablet, cylinder seal, and Arabic calligraphy workshops; and film, lectures, and Exchange-with-an-Expert sessions. A Middle East Bazaar features tea, food and craft vendors, and a spice cart beckoning guests to smell, touch, and learn about the region's spices. Zoo on Wheels brings in animals from the Middle East, while outside, a local Middle Eastern Unity Cup team demonstrates football (soccer), a favorite sport of the region. Farah Siraj, internationally renowned Jordanian virtuoso vocalist, performs on Saturday and Al-Bustan Ensemble offers up "An Afternoon of Classical & Contemporary Arab Music" on Sunday afternoon. Creative engineering activities invite guests to build structures from unorthodox materials (marshmallows or spaghetti, anyone?), or to build cities at a Lego building station, connecting with the galleries' millennia-long journey to the city. The landscape of the Middle East--and some of Penn Museum's excavation sites-- can be explored via Google Cardboard. A cities-focused Instagram Scavenger Hunt, a matching game exploring the region's biodiversity, and a Middle East art activities station, round out the activities.]]></perf_description>

These initiatives have been set up by the village itself in collaboration with local, national, and overseas agencies. Moreover, the community organizes its tourism business in a way which aims to spread the benefits of tourism to as many households as possible. Agua Blanca's experience shows that much can be achieved through growing confidence in cultural identity, and that there are alternative ways of managing and assuring local benefits from tourism. Nevil Classroom.]]></perf_description>

In the closing lecture of the Wolf Humanities Center's 2017-18 Forum on Afterlives, Dr. Holly Pittman, Curator, Near East Section; Penn's Bok Family Professor in the Humanities; and a curator of the new Middle East Galleries, describes the Queen's tomb, how it reflects the elaborate and expensive rituals associated with the passing of members of elite society from this world to the next, and what this tells us about notions of life after death in early Mesopotamia.Before the lecture, guests are invited to tour Penn Museum's new Middle East Galleries. 3:00-4:00pm: Curator-led Tours (pre-registration required); 4:00-5:00: Open Gallery.

<perf_description><![CDATA[The IHT continues its season with a timely exploration of the lives of Irish women with a host of beautiful plays featuring great female characters directed by three fierce female directors: Tori Mittelman, Marcia Ferguson and Tina Brock.  We begin with the heartbreaking tragedy of Riders to the Sea by John Millington Synge (directed by Tori Mittelman), in which Maurya has lost her husband and most of her sons to the unrelenting sea and now fears the worst for her other two sons. Her daughters struggle with how they will share the truth with Maurya without destroying what is left of this strong, powerful woman. In Cathleen Ni Houlihan by Lady Gregory and W.B. Yeats, a mysterious old woman visits the Gillane family and it is soon clear that she is the much abused Mother Ireland calling for the ultimate sacrifice in the fight for Irish independence. Finally, we have four contemporary shorts by female playwrights from Fishamble's Tiny Plays for Ireland: Poster Boy by Antonia Hart, Hearts by Lucy Montague-Moffat, and Joan Ryan's Isolation (all directed by Tina Brock). All of these plays explore women's lives in modern Irish society in ways that are simultaneously smart, funny and insightful.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[The Go Rounds are bits of all your favorite bands exploded into rock n' roll confetti. Their unique brand of psychedelic Americana pop crosses, blends and deconstructs genres from indie to country, to art rock and baroque folk; creating an accessible and engaging experience that will leave you talking for long after the show. The songs are catchy, twangy and trippy - led by lead singer Graham Parsons' spellbinding vocals, which weave through lush sonic textures and the band's master class of intricate arrangements.  Opening up the show is a new garage rock power trio out of Delaware. Grace Vonderkuhn is a rocker whose music combines psych and garage rock with a sharp pop sensibility.]]></perf_description>

<perf_name><![CDATA[Bowerbird Presents "Long/Gone"]]></perf_name>
<perf_description><![CDATA[Currently over 100 feet in length, "Long/Gone" is a single intricately-cut piece of paper which flows freely from image to image. Narratives and scenarios (often drawn from classic works of literature from Homer to Dante) emerge and collapse and spill over into each other. In performance, Erik scrolls the paper-cut continually across the surface of an over-head projector, creating an epic and immersive shadow-show. His musical group, the Ominous Cloud Ensemble, will provide a live soundtrack. About the artists: Erik Ruin is a Michigan-raised, Philadelphia-based printmaker, shadow puppeteer, paper-cut artist, etc., who has been lauded by the New York Times for his "spell-binding cut-paper animations." His work oscillates between the poles of apocalyptic anxieties and utopian yearnings, with an emphasis on empathy, transcendence and obsessive detail. He frequently works collaboratively with musicians, theater performers, other artists and activist campaigns. He is a founding member of the international Justseeds Artists' Cooperative, and co-author of the book Paths Toward Utopia: Graphic Explorations of Everyday Anarchism (w/ Cindy Milstein, PM Press, 2012). Erik Ruin's Ominous Cloud Ensemble is an ever-evolving, collectively-improvising large ensemble for projections and music, led by visual artist Erik Ruin. Erik manipulates intricate paper-cuts and painted films on overhead projectors to create abstract landscapes and fragmentary scenes that are nonetheless charged with meaning, merging with music that ranges from dark atmospherics to ecstatic peaks of dissonance. Members of the ensemble include a rotating cast of Philly's finest musicians, who have collaborated with everyone from Anthony Braxton to the Sun Ra Arkestra, Chris Forsyth to Bardo Pond.     Tara Middleton, voice;  DM Hotep, guitar;  Reid Hoffman, guitar;  Nick Millevoi, guitar;  Myles Donovan, viola, harp;  Jesse Sparhawk, harp, banjo;  Julius Masri, electronics, kamancheh;  Quinn Collins, bass;  and Scott Verrastro, drums, percussion.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[The Historic Odessa Foundation is pleased to present the exhibit As Precious as Gold: A History of Tea Caddies from The Bramble Collection. The exhibit features more than 150 18th and 19th century tea caddies from the vast Bramble collection and will be on display from April 3 to August 26, 2018. The tea caddy collection was built over two generations and includes more than 400 examples, spanning the period from 1700 to the present. Marnie Bramble of Chestertown, Maryland, started the collection more than half a century ago, and enjoined her youngest son Mark in her hobby.  Author, theatre director, and producer Mark Bramble has penned many Broadway musicals including Barnum and the Tony Award Winning Best Musical 42nd Street, which have been presented all over the world. Travelling with his shows provides Bramble with unique opportunities for collecting, which is the subject of his book A Tea Caddy Collection recently published by Schiffer Publishing. The exhibit will be displayed in two of the Historic Houses of Odessa - the National Historic Register Wilson-Warner House (c. 1769), and the National Historic Landmark Corbit-Sharp House (c. 1774). The displays feature tea caddies arranged in fascinating groups that focus on materials and origin. The caddies and accoutrements are incorporated into the houses' historic period rooms, and will include select items from the Historic Odessa Foundation's permanent collection.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Bowerbird is pleased to present a night featuring New York-based pianist Anthony Coleman + Philadelphia trombonist Dan Blacksberg. These far-reaching musicians will each play full solo sets before coming together at the end to play an extended duo piece. A key figure of the downtown New York scene since the early 1980s, pianist Anthony Coleman is a virtuoso of jazz from Jelly Roll Morton to Herbie Nichols to John Zorn and his own scores, not to mention ventures in Klezmer. All Music Guide praised Anthony's "Freakish" solo album of Jelly Roll Morton tunes for having "just the right blend of poetic license and personal vision," as well as "breathtaking dramatic command." Called "A virtuosic technician with abundant creativity" by All About Jazz New York, Dan Blacksberg has become a major voice carving out new paths in both Jewish and experimental music. From performing and recording with traditional klezmer musicians like Elaine Hoffman Watts and Adrienne Cooper, to experimentalists George Lewis and Anthony Braxton, to performing with his own groups Electric Simcha and Deveykus (the worlds only hardcore simcha band and Hasidic doom-metal band respectively), his work spans from the traditional to the avant-garde and radical spaces in between.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company in collaboration with The Ahn Trio makes its company debut on the NextMove Dance Series in A Quest for Freedom, a new collaborative multi-cultural production featuring live music and dance, Prince Theater, 1412 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA in five performances April 19-22.  The Ahn Trio, three Korean sisters, Juilliard trained have released six albums and are recognized for bringing the 21st century and youthfulness to chamber music.  Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company, under the artistic direction of Taiwanese born Nai-Ni Chen is the recipient of 15 awards from the National Endowment for the Arts. Her movement vocabulary draws from the flowing lines of Chinese calligraphy to the explosiveness of martial arts to the innovation of contemporary dance.  A Quest for Freedom, a full-length work choreographed by artistic director Nai-Ni Chen, explores personal stories of leaving one's country, home and family and emigrating to a new place in search of freedom and dreams. It highlights the current societal, historical, national and international debate regarding immigration.  This 12-section work features seven athletic and exquisite dancers, three world-class musicians, stunning projections and props. Opening the program is Space Oddity, a full-company work inspired by the Ahn Trio's adaption of David Bowie's music which reminded Chen of her first visit to New York in 1982.  Concrete Stream features new music by Kenji Bunch for the Ahn Trio. Chen's choreography for Concrete Stream was inspired by Persian poet Latif Nazemi's "A Word for Freedom." Throughout the production the musicians and dancers are interconnected with the dancers relating to musicians and musicians moving alongside of the dancers. Nai-Ni Chen notes. "A Quest For Freedom can be looked at in so many different ways.  It is an on-going quest truly for each one of us regardless of gender, race and the country we are living in."              Positioning, a duet section set to music by Ludovico Einaudi, Nuvole Bianch and Antônio Carolos Jobim, examines gender, power and a quest for harmony and resolution.  Full-ensemble sections include Shapes of Water to music by Pat Metheny, Path to music by Zoe Keating, Tomorrow to music by Chiel Meijering, Dreamland to David Bowie/Pat Metheny and Arrival to Kenji Bunch's "Night Flight," created along with "Concert Stream" especially for this production.   The program also features three musical selections performed by Lucia Ahn (piano), Maria Ahn (cello) and Angella Ahn (violin). These include Heart Asks Pleasure First composed by Michael Nyman, Grooveboxes  by Kenji Bunch and Skylight  by David Balakrishnan, arranged by Kenji Bunch. In addition to the performances, Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company with the Ahn Trio will be offering outreach activities.  The company  will conduct a Student Discovery Program for schools on Friday April 20 at 10:30am and a master class on Friday, April 20 at 1pm, Koresh Dance Center, 2002 Rittenhouse Street. In addition, there will be two post-performance chats that will take place after Friday's 8pm and Saturday's 2pm performances.  Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company: Bringing the dynamic freedom of American modern dance together with the elegant splendor of Asian art, the Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company is one of the most visible Asian American dance companies in America.  Ms. Chen's unique choreography transports audiences beyond cultural boundaries to the common ground between tradition and innovation, discipline and freedom, and form and spirit.  Visit http://nainichen.org/ The Ahn Trio:  Hailed as "exacting and exciting musicians" by the LA Times, the three sisters of the Ahn Trio (Lucia on the piano, Angella on the violin, and Maria on the cello) have earned a distinguished reputation for embracing 21st century classical music with their unique style and innovative collaborations.   In 2011, President Obama invited the Ahn Trio to perform at the White House for a State Dinner honoring South Korea. Luminary composers as Michael Nyman, Maurice Jarre, Pat Metheny, Paul Schoenfield, Mark O' Connor, Kenji Bunch, Nikolai Kapustin, and Paul Chihara have written works for them. The trio's latest CD, "Lullaby for My Favorite Insomniac" (released by Sony) is a showcase of their fearless creativity, which made No. 8 on the Billboard Charts for 26 weeks in the Classical album category.  visit;www.nextmovedance.org]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Experience the exciting jungle adventure of Roxey Ballet's Mowgli, based on Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book.      A young man raised by wolves and tempered by the dangers of the jungle, Mowgli struggles to find his way to a village populated by this own kind. Drawn from the stories of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book, Mowgli sets virtuosic choreography by artistic director Mark Roxey against vivid sets that capture the wildness of the protagonist. An evocative score by Czech composer Milan Svoboda, meanwhile, mingles traditional orchestration with anthemic set pieces that draw on European pop music and Svoboda's other callings as a jazz pianist, bandleader, and part-time wolf.     Mowgli is a family-friendly performance for children of all ages. The story itself teaches audience members that one should let go one's fears and move forward.    The production is directed by Mark Roxey, director and co-founder of this acclaimed professional company, and features more than 100 costumes designed by Alicia Worden and Nilda Roxey and unique lighting design by Jeffrey Goldstein. Complemented by an international star cast of professional performers, Roxey Ballet draws on the abundant local talent pool from neighboring communities, including Lambertville, New Hope, Hopewell, Titusville, Lawrenceville, Pennington, Ewing, and Princeton.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[We will start the day with a one hour guided tour of the beautiful Hershey Gardens, established in 1937 by Milton Hershey for his community and to honor his wife Catherine. When the Gardens originally opened they consisted of only Rose Gardens. As the years passed Milton Hershey added more Gardens and enlarged them to their current size , 23 acres . The most significant of these changes was the creation of six theme Gardens , followed by the opening of the Butterfly House. Today the gardens include an arboretum, the Children's Garden, an Herb Garden, Japanese Garden, Magnolia Grove, Oak Grove, Ornamental grass collection, two substantial Rose Gardens and more. After the docent tour we will have time to explore on our own. When we leave Hershey Gardens we will travel to the Mill Restaurant in Hershey for our lunch. The Mill is located in what was the historic Curry Feed Mill, a distinctive building in Hershey that dates back to the early 1900s. Great strides were taken to preserve the original structure to provide a unique ambiance for the diners. After lunch we will be joined by our step on guide for a tour of the "Sweetest Place on Earth"--Hershey. You will learn the history and folklore of a town built on chocolate. We'll visit Founders Hall built as a tribute to Milton and Catherine Hershey. The Hall is located on the campus of the Milton Hershey School, a school for disadvantaged children. We will end the day with a visit to Chocolate World which will show us the making of chocolate from raw product to the yummy delicacy that we love. Location: a deluxe coach will leave from the St. Mary Rehabilitation Hospital parking lot.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[East Coast collectors of political buttons, badges, ribbons and related ephemera will meet in Titusville, NJ, on Saturday, April 28, to sell, trade and display memorabilia from elections throughout the centuries. Attendees from multiple states may expect to see a wide variety of political items, ranging from 2016 presidential-campaign buttons promoting candidates Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, to items from such popular former presidents as Teddy R. and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama. The gathering will be hosted by the local chapter of the American Political Items Collectors (APIC) national non-profit hobbyist association, dedicated to preserving political history. "We invite the young and old alike to learn more about collecting buttons from the heated 2016 presidential campaign, as well as from other campaigns throughout American history," says Tony Lee, a Titusville resident, political historian and president of APIC's Big Apple Chapter.  "Most political items don't survive the elections in which they were used, so to see an ‘I Like Ike' apron or a Ronald Reagan cowboy hat or a clothing button worn at George Washington's inauguration and inscribed with ‘Long Live the President' is a great experience for students of political history at any age." The historic Titusville United Methodist Church is located at 7 Church Road - at the corner of River Road (Route 29) and Church Road - in Titusville, due south of Lambertville, NJ, and due north of the state capital, Trenton, NJ.  The button show will be held in the church's Education Building.  Ample free parking is available. Admission to the event will be $3 for each adult.  Any child 12 years or younger will enter free of charge.  To encourage a lifelong love of political history and collecting, each child will receive assorted buttons, free of charge, to start his or her own personal collection.  Free appraisals will be offered for all political items brought in by members of the public; members of the public also may bring items for auction, with a commission rate of 10 percent of the overall sale.  A wide selection of baked goods and other items, and bottomless cups of hot coffee and tea, will be offered for sale (with net food-sale proceeds benefiting the church and its ministries).  For more information, please contact Tony Lee at 609-310-0817 or tonylee08560@gmail.com.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[DVAA is proud to host To Print or Not To Print, an exhibition of objects, printmaking, paintings, and other works by Edna Santiago. In Edna's own words, "communicating, connections, listening, and expressing are all part of what I enjoy about being an artist. Painting, printmaking, and gourd lamp shades are where I express myself, by what fits my mood. Printing slows me down and brings me peace while helping me appreciate values and light in my works, while painting helps me express my feelings with color as my guide. Gourd lamps and ornaments help me appreciate the delicate and valuable material that naturally surrounds me. My gourd lamps are arefully worked, after selection of the gourd, cut, cleaned, bleached, designed, and carved out with a Dremel tool, then painted and decorated. Fitting lampshades to each specific lamp highlights its elegant and unique details. This work involves sharing and learning with each experience."]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Mary Vaux Walcott was a gifted artist whose nearly 1,000 watercolors of North American wildflowers earned her the title of the "Audubon of Botany". Married late in life, she accompanied her husband on trips to the American and Canadian Rockies during which time she painted the native flora of the region. In 1925, the Smithsonian Institution published 400 of her illustrations in a five-volume work entitled North American Wild Flowers. Marjorie presents a fascinating look at Mary Walcott, a remarkable illustrator and an intrepid woman who sought escape from Victorian social conventions and pursued adventure and self-expression in the American west during the transformative times in which she lived. The talk will be supplemented with selected prints of Walcott's original paintings from Mrs. Copeland's collections. Light refreshments will be served. Copies of Marjorie's book, The Life and Times of Mary Vaux Walcott, will be available for purchase and signing after the lecture. Marjorie G. Jones is a graduate of Wheaton College (MA) and the Rutgers School of Law. After 25 years in banking and executive recruitment, she returned to school and earned an MA in Historical Studies at the Graduate Faculty of the New School in New York City. She has taught at The New School, Mercy College, and, most recently, at Graterford Prison for Villanova University. A member of the Writing Women's Lives seminar in NYC, she lives in Philadelphia.]]></perf_description>

<perf_name><![CDATA[Short & Strange: Fiction Reading with Castillo & White]]></perf_name>
<perf_description><![CDATA[The "All But True" reading series presents an evening of flash fiction with Sebastian Castillo and Sharon White.  Both of these authors use the short-short-story form to explore surreal situations that bear a provocative resemblance to our "ordinary" world. Sebastian Castillo's "49 Venezuelan Novels" confounds readers' expectations by stripping the novel down to its barest bones. Each novel occupies a single page. Some consist of a single sentence. Yet Castillo draws on the power of innuendo, intimation, and absence to create narratives eerily rich in their sparseness. Castillo was born in Caracas, Venezuela, and grew up in New York. Said Blake Butler, author of 300,000,000, "Sebastian Castillo's micro-fictional assemblages invoke a logical illogic wherein nothing is untrue or impossible, secrets have secrets, and any sentence can change the world.... A magical, medicinal mini-encyclopedia for our ongoing human rune." Sharon White, a multi-award-winning poet and author of creative nonfiction, turns to fiction with the inventive "Boiling Lake (On Voyage)",  micro-tales of travel to the past, present, future--and other worlds. White's exquisite prose and off-kilter juxtapositions turn even familiar territory strange and unsettling. "With mad singing in strange lands and familiar places, these tiny stories speak a language of dark lyricism," says Amy Parkison, author of "The Petals of Your Eyes." White's awards include include the Italo Calvino Prize in Fabulist Fiction, the Marguerite McGlinn Prize for Fiction from Philadelphia Stories, the Neil Shepard Prize in Fiction from Green Mountains Review, a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship for Creative Nonfiction, the Leeway Foundation Award for Achievement, a Colorado Council on the Arts Fellowship, and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship. The event includes author readings, discussion, book signings, and (following our tradition) lots of snacks. Note the new location at Penn Book Center, 34th & Sansom.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[‘Thollem's Technicolor Grey Zone' is a multimedia experience pairing Thollem's live musical scoring to films. This year he's focusing on the films of Martha Colburn (U.S./Holland), Tuia Cherici (Italy/France) and ACVilla (U.S.).  This is an unforgettable show, bringing together the work of these 3 unique filmmakers with Thollem's Prophet, field recordings and a microphone: jumping from an electric diving board into reality and imagination, landing squarely in the midst of the time of our lives at the center of a world on the edge. Thollem has worked with each of these three filmmakers on various projects throughout North America and Europe including Maxxi Museum in Rome, Philadelphia Museum of Art, New Museum, SF MOMA, Crowley Theater, San Diego Institute of Art, Crystal Bridges, Toledo Museum of Art, Trinosophes, Pioneer Works, Northwest Film Forum, Sundance, Rotterdam Film Festival and more. He will be creating a special electronic sound environment for this event, taking into consideration the cavernous acoustics of the Icebox Project Space. Martha Colburn: Born in rural Pennsylvania, USA, Martha Colburn is an artist and filmmaker. Her films have screened in the Venice Biennelle, The Stedelijk Museum, Art Basel, Sundance Film Festival and Cannes Film Festival. She is a 2015 recipient of the Creative Capital Award for film. Colburn's works "deploy the language and materials of filmmaking to comment on popular culture, history, politics and sexuality. Her primary focus has been on contemporary topics through a montage of techniques combining live action, animation and found footage." Tuia Cherici was born and raised in Italy and presently lives in Marseille. She has performed and collaborated internationally with myriad artists across multiple disciplines and approaches. "I create videos using handcraft techniques of stop-motion, projection, and objects' manipulation. The whole process of creation (scenario, set construction, animation, shooting and editing) I do in a small space using a miniDv camera,  a projector, one lap-top. Most of their contents result from my fascination with experienced dreams and puzzling mental images associations inspired by everyday materials. Music, free improvised or composed by musicians I have a deep relationship with, constitutes often the leading thread of my inspiration." ACVilla: A professional culture worker since 1990, ACVilla has focused her time as a peripatetic traveler, musicians' representative, photographer and video artist for the past decade. Looking at a scene both as a whole and as a unique union of colors, shapes, textures and circumstances, ACVilla brings the viewer into her present moment to experience what would otherwise be lost in the momentum of daily life. ACVilla's work has been shown throughout the US in DIY spaces, museums, galleries, schools and universities, some being: Pioneer Works (Brooklyn NY); Northwest Film Forum (Seattle, WA); Toledo Museum Of Art (Toledo, OH); Krannert Art Museum (Univ of Il. Urbana) and Park Church Co-Op: Benefit for NoDAPL (Brooklyn, NY). Rova Saxophone Quartet premiered No Distractions, her video piece written for the quartet for their 40th anniversary. Thollem is a pianist, keyboardist, composer, improviser, singer-songwriter, activist, author and teacher. He's spent his life skirting and erasing the edges of boundaries musically, culturally, geographically. His work is ever changing, evolving and responding to the times and his experiences, both as a soloist and in collaboration with hundreds of artists across idioms and disciplines. Thollem's known internationally as an acoustic piano player in the free jazz and post-classical worlds, as the lead vocalist for the Italian agit-punk band Tsigoti and more recently as an electronic keyboardist through a multitude of projects including Who Are U.S. 2016 with the filmmaker ACVilla.]]></perf_description>

<perf_name><![CDATA[The Life of Ulysses S. Grant: Myths and Misunderstandings]]></perf_name>
<perf_description><![CDATA[Phoenixville Public Library will host a first-person portrayal of Ulysses S. Grant, "The Life of Ulysses S. Grant: Myths and Misunderstandings", on Monday, April 23 at 7:00 PM.  Professional living historian Kenneth J. Serfass portrays Grant, the U.S. president and general who died as one of the most beloved and respected men of the Victorian age.  However, he is now regarded by many as a hard-drinking 'butcher' who had little regard for human life or respect for his enemies. Ken's portrayal of General Grant seeks to restore his reputation by helping attendees understand the Victorian era mindset and offering insight "straight from the horse's mouth".  Serfass contends that tenacity, respect, humility, patriotism and many other values characterized Grant's true nature as a loving family man and regular man of the people.  Gunnery Sgt Kenneth J. Serfass is a native of Bethlehem, PA.  He joined the USMC in 1984, and his final tour was with the First Marine Division Band during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He retired from the Marine Corps in 2004 to become a music teacher.  Ken is now a first-person impressionist with over forty years of study of his self-avowed childhood hero, US Grant.  Ken has been appearing publically as General Grant since 2009.  He has visited many areas of Grant's military campaigns across the South.  He presents the general in as many venues as are relevant to the life of US Grant, from horseback rides and railroad excursions to various living history and roundtable events on a regular basis across many eastern and southern states, as well as southern California.  It is with a profound honor that Ken tells the story of one of America's greatest military leaders, and he takes it very seriously to reaffirm Grant's place of honor among the most respected people of our nation's history.  Ken's passion for the subject is evident in his presentation, and it is hard not to be affected by his enthusiasm for his subject and believe that you've met US Grant in living history.      This event is free and open to the public.  Reservations are required on the Adult Events Calendar at www.phoenixvillelibrary.org or by calling 610-933-3013 x132.  Phoenixville Public Library is located at 183 Second Avenue, Phoenixville, PA.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[An estimated 1,800 people are expected to raise more than $200,000 at Walk MS: Philadelphia on May 5 at the Art Museum. Walk MS is an opportunity for people to come together with friends, loved ones and co-workers to fundraise, connect and advocate for people affected by MS. Each dollar raised is one step closer to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's goal - a world free of MS. Since its inception in 1988, Walk MS has cumulatively raised more than $1 billion. "Walk MS is all about community - people coming together to raise money and show support for loved ones, colleagues and friends," said Cyndi Zagieboylo, President and CEO of the National MS Society. "Funds raised have a direct impact in this community, for example - our MS Navigator program. MS Navigators are highly-skilled, compassionate professionals available to connect each person affected by MS to the resources and information they need to live their best lives." When: Saturday, May 5 at 7:30 a.m., walk begins at 8:30 a.m. Where: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2600 Benjamin Franklin Pkwy, Philadelphia 19130. Why Walk MS? Walk MS helps fuel groundbreaking MS research and provide life-changing services to those affected by MS through creating a supportive community of friends, families and loved ones who fundraise and connect. To find a walk near you, to participate or to volunteer, visit walkMS.org, call 855-372-1331 or email fundraisingsupport@nmss.org. Multiple sclerosis attacks the brain and spinal cord, and it is the most common neurological disease leading to disability in young adults. The National MS Society is a gathering place for people with MS, their family and loved ones, healthcare providers, volunteers, donors, fundraisers, advocates, community leaders and all those that seek a world free of MS.  Sanofi Genzyme is the premier national sponsor of Walk MS. Biogen, Genentech and Novartis are national sponsors of Walk MS. About Multiple Sclerosis :Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain, and between the brain and body. Symptoms range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to a world free of MS. Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, with at least two to three times more women than men being diagnosed with the disease. MS affects more than 2.3 million worldwide. For more information about multiple sclerosis and the National MS Society go to nationalMSsociety.org or call   800-344-4867.]]></perf_description>

Having a good ear and/or being a good mimic can help you, but it won't take you as far as technique grounded in specifics! Most productions these days cannot or will not hire a dialect coach so it falls to the actors to coach themselves. Roger will teach you how! From basic vowel substitutions to melody and tempo to vocal posture and placement, Roger will take you through a step by step methodology. We will apply it to a specific accent over the course of the workshop, but by the end you will be able to use this technique for any dialect in any show you do.

<perf_name><![CDATA[SALT Performing Arts: Titanic, The Musical]]></perf_name>
<perf_description><![CDATA[SALT Performing Arts presents the Tony Award winning drama, Titanic the Musical, April 13-29. The sinking of the Titanic in the early hours of April 15, 1912, remains the quintessential disaster of the twentieth century. The fact that the finest, largest, strongest ship in the world-called, in fact, the "unsinkable" ship-should have been lost during its maiden voyage is so incredible that, had it not actually happened, no author would have dared to contrive it. Maury Yeston and Peter Stone's musical examines the lives of the passengers aboard the doomed luxury liner Titanic - those in first class, middle class and steerage - in the nights leading up the ship's fatal encounter with an iceberg at sea. "When most people think of Titanic as a production, they think of the movie. Our show is actually more like a documentary-turned-musical," explains Lauren McComas, SALT President & Artistic Director. "Spanning all classes, Titanic captures the actual stories from the whole range of humanity aboard the ship: from boiler room workers to first-class attendants, from third-class ticketholders scraping together their lifesavings for the promise of the American dream, to some of the wealthiest men of the Victorian age, including John Jacob Astor and Benjamin Guggenheim. And yet the biggest character of the show is Titanic herself, and the actual events and timeline that led up to her sinking." Titanic will be the biggest and most spectacular production produced by SALT Performing Arts.  The cast consists of 40 talented performers aging from 6 to 70 and a full live orchestra. Veterans and several talented SALT newbies make up this cast from Chester and the surrounding counties.  Directed by Elizabeth Hennessey, Titanic runs approximately 2.5 hours with an intermission.  Concessions are available for purchase in the lobby from Cookies by Design before the show and during intermission.  Reserved seating is offered.  Adults are $25 and Children ages 12 and under are $17. Handicap seating is also available. Tickets can be purchased at: https://www.saltpa.com/titanic-the-musical/  Please note: all ticket sales are final.  Production Staff: , Elizabeth Hennessey, Director; David DiMarino, Music Director; Mike Toolan, Assistant Music Director; Lauren McComas, Producer & Assistant Director; Chelsea Barnett, Stage Manager; Kathy deVries, Costume Designer; Rob Merow, Set & Lighting Designer. The mission of SALT Performing Arts is to provide live community theatre productions, summer/year long theatre camps for kids, dinner theatre and more.

People with autism often struggle with sensory overload and have a hard time processing too much touch, taste, sight and sound--which makes visiting an amusement park next to impossible. The goal of this event is to remove those obstacles so families with children on the spectrum can not only attend the park but really enjoy it. This is the first time ever that an amusement park of the magnitude of Six Flags has been transformed into a sensory-friendly environment, and we are excited to make this event happen.]]></perf_description>

"Voices in The Family" was an award winning mental health call in radio show. Currently, the show has moved from its weekly format to 6 times a year.         About Dr. Gottlieb's Presentation:    When we asked Dr Gottlieb about the essence of "Parenting From the Heart" he said; "Ever since Dr. Spock, we parents have been subjected to "guidance" from professionals. The dangers of too much discipline, and the dangers of not enough. Overindulging and neglected children are at risk. And now there is stranger danger! How did we survive without this advice ? We parented based on what was happening in our hearts rather than fearing what was in our heads". "Parenting From The Heart" will be about reclaiming the wisdom we were born with        Dr. Gottlieb will present about Parenting from the Heart and How to change the difficult job of Parenting to one of JOY!]]></perf_description>

<perf_name><![CDATA[Aloud]]></perf_name>
<perf_description><![CDATA[Good music has a catchy rhythm, a hummable melody, and--if you're lucky--an unforgettable chorus. But great music has something else, something it's almost impossible to capture: soul. Enter Aloud. Henry Beguiristain and Jen de la Osa have been the core and soul of the band since their teens in Miami. A shared passion for rock classics like the Beatles, Oasis, Aretha Franklin, and Otis Redding led the pair to start writing and recording their own music. A relocation to Boston where deep ties were formed in the local rock scene, combined with connecting with Aloud's bassist, Charles Murphy pulled the band into focus. After one final relocation, this time to Los Angeles Aloud was brought into razor sharp focus.   Dedicated musicianship pays dividends. First on local, then national tours, the band started honing a sound that has earned comparisons to the Alabama Shakes and the Black Keys. Their latest single, "Falling Out of Love", reveals an evolution of the band, showcasing their incredible harmonies in a soulful ballad reminiscent of the classic Muscle Shoals sound. The B-side gives listeners a glimpse into the band's formidable range; rock-edged with elements of psychedelia, "Empty House" is urgent, with a driving chorus you can't get out of your head. Together, the songs on the Falling Out of Lovesingle form a perfect bridge between the propulsive pop songs the band has been known for, and their upcoming full-length, a more heavily R&B-influenced effort featuring a full horn section. The upcoming album was produced by Grammy award winner Benny Grotto (Magnetic Fields, Ben Folds) and mixed by Guy Massey (Paul McCartney, Manic Street Preachers, The Libertines). For Aloud it's full steam ahead. According to de la Osa, this is just the beginning.]]></perf_description>

Join the Merion Concert Band as we celebrate female composers and their contributions to the concert band repertoire. In a performance jointly directed by Conductor Nathan Snyder and Assistant Conductor Ashley Smith, we pay long-neglected and well-deserved homage to women in music.

Join us for an exhilarating glow-light rock concert where everyone gets to be the star drummer! The Ripstix used for POUND Fitness classes just so happen to light up under black lights, so we're amping it up at our Midtown studio with this extended workshop featuring 90 minutes of energizing drum fitness routines.  POUND pro duo, Lehla and Maureen, will take turns leading this full-body jam session, which uses simulated drumming with lightly weighted sticks to burn calories and tone muscle. Relieve stress and get a killer workout at the same time as you "pound" along to great music. Expect a mix of cardio, Pilates, isometric poses, plyometrics and plenty of strength conditioning: squats, lunges, hip-raises, arm swings, squats and lunges. We guarantee you'll feel the impact of this party in all the best ways. No prior drumming or POUND experience required. Maureen and Lehla will break down the form and any tricky combinations so that everyone can unleash their inner rock stars. We'll bring the sticks, mats, light refreshments (with neon plastic cups of course!) and maybe even some glow-in-the-dark accessories. All you need to do is show up ready to sweat. If you can, wear white or neon to add to the color fun!    Space is limited by the number of Ripstix, so please pre-register to reserve your spot.]]></perf_description>

This anti-story imagines an AI being who moves in and outside of human patterned constructs, forests, and time. "Human" is a ballet that uses a traditional idiom to consider future sensibility. The work is choreographed by Nora Gibson, with an original music score by noted ambient electronic composer Michael McDermott (AKA Mikronesia). This evening-length ballet features a cast of five outstanding dancers, Marria Cosentino-Chapin, Brian Cordova, Sean Thomas Boyt, Katharine Nace, and Hallie Lahm.  Nora Gibson premieres her new work, "Human," as the inaugural recipient of the Performance Garage's Dr. RJ Wallner DanceVisions Residency. The Residency was designed by Executive Director Jeanne Ruddy in order to support a Philadelphia dance artist who exhibits exceptional talent. The inaugural year is supported by a generous gift from Dr. RJ Wallner. Ms. Gibson was selected for her ability to thoroughly immerse her audiences in her work through her meticulous choreography, careful lighting design, and use of original music scores. The Performance Garage is proud to support her innovative work.  Run time is approximately 40 minutes. An artist Q&A will follow the Sunday, April 22 performance.    Please note that haze will be used during the performance]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA["What does it mean to defend the dead? To tend to the Black dead and dying: to tend to the Black person, to Black people, always living in the push toward our death?" Christina Sharpe, In the Wake: On Blackness and Being. With majesty, opulence, and agency, Séancers examines how the American racialized body uses psychic, spiritual, and theoretical strategies to shapeshift through loss and oppression. This journey into the surreal and fantastical states of the Black imagination traverses the "fatal" axis of abstraction, illegibility, and gender complexity with a collapsing of lyrical poetry, movement forms, and discursive performance. Jaamil Olawale Kosoko is a Bessie Award nominated Nigerian-American curator, poet, and performance artist. Séancers includes sound artist Jeremy Toussaint-Baptiste and video installation by Andrew Amorim.]]></perf_description>

Music at the Museum: An Opera Performance with American Baritone Troy Cook, Thursday April 19th, 2018, 6-9pm, at the National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem. In 1910, in an effort to boost morale and heal the wounds left behind by a tumultuous strike at the Bethlehem Steel plant, then president Charles Schwab formed the Bethlehem Steel Company Band. The National Museum of Industrial History is bringing music to the museum with a memorable evening featuring a special performance by American baritone Troy Cook of Opera Philadelphia. Guests will have a chance to soothe their souls with elegant performances by Mr. Cook and step back in time to explore the Museum's galleries with expert guides. Wine and light appetizers will be served. All proceeds benefit the Museum's ongoing educational programs and exhibits and the care and preservation of its unique collections. About the Performer: Troy Cook made notable debuts in past seasons as Ford in Hamburgische Staatsoper's Falstaff, following his debut with the company as Marcello in La bohème, and with the Royal Opera, Covent Garden as Guglielmo in Così fan tutte.? Troy began the 2017-2018 season creating the role of John Cree in the world premiere of Elizabeth Cree with Opera Philadelphia. He bows as Enrico in Lucia di Lammermoor with Florida Grand Opera, Rodrigo in Don Carlo with Washington National Opera, and Falke in Die Fledermaus with Utah Opera and Des Moines Metro Opera. He also appears in concert with the Charlotte Symphony and Memphis Symphony for Handel's Messiah. "He has a beautiful, robust, woolen baritone, the sort that flows effortlessly in its middle range, and gathers energy as it climbs higher, never showing the faintest hint of a blemish."-Eric Simpson, The New Criterion    Tickets and details available at http://nmih.org/nmihevents/music-at-the-museum-with-troy-cook/]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Experience religious art in the making at Glencairn Museum during its annual Sacred Arts Festival. The festival features an array of demonstrations throughout the afternoon, from glassblowing and icon writing to solo-voice music and the creation of a sand mandala, that give visitors a unique view of many beautiful expressions of faith from various cultures. This event is also a rare opportunity to experience the Museum's vast collection of religious art and artifacts--and the castle itself--while touring its many galleries and public spaces. At their leisure, visitors are invited to explore room by room, take in the exciting view from Glencairn's tower or relax in the Castle Café.   Admission includes all festival demonstrations and access to the galleries and the tower as well as the Museum's 15-minute orientation video and cell-phone audio tour of the collections.     This year's Sacred Arts Festival includes these demonstrations:  *Glassblowing with Jason Klein  *Metal forging with Rachel Kedinger  *Stained glass painting with J. Kenneth Leap  *Sand mandala completion and dismantling with Losang Samten  *Icon writing with Susan Kelly vonMedicus  *Solo-voice music with Les Canards Chantants  *Stone carving with Jens Langlotz  *Mosaic making with Carol Stirton-Broad  *Replica Gutenberg-era printing press with Kirsten Gyllenhaal  *Dance by inFlux Dance Company of Bryn Athyn College. Of special interest are the Tibetan Buddhist sand mandala, created over 5 days and ritually dismantled late Sunday afternoon by The Venerable Lama Losang Samten, and the glassblowing demonstration by Historical Glassworks' Jason Klein, who is working to bring medieval skills back to life while researching the centuries' old striated ruby red glass that Bryn Athyn artisans famously recreated in the early 20th century.  Please note: During the festival, the elevator stops only at the 1st and 5th floors and the Tower. Please use the stairs while exploring Glencairn Museum's galleries on all other floors.  No strollers or backpack-style baby carriers allowed in the Museum and no wheelchairs permitted beyond the first floor.  Photography for private use is permitted. No flash, tripods, selfie-sticks or videography.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Glencairn Museum mounts an exhibition of 20 paintings and drawings by the late Bryn Athyn artist and arts instructor Nishan Yardumian (1947-1986). "A Window to the Soul: Nishan Yardumian's Biblical Art" opens Sunday, April 22, during the Museum's annual Sacred Arts Festival and continues through Sunday, November 4, in Glencairn's Upper Hall exhibition space. Yardumian taught painting in Bryn Athyn for many years, at both the Academy of the New Church Secondary Schools and Bryn Athyn College. A painter as well as a teacher, he was passionate about both professions. According to Yardumian, "Painting aims at the universal with the hopes that each individual can find his identification with it. Teaching aims at the individual with the hope of developing the universal." Visitors are welcome to tour the exhibition Tuesday through Friday as part of the Museum's regular 2:30pm "Highlights Tour" and on weekends 1-4:30pm (walk-ins welcome), as well as by appointment and when attending the Sacred Arts and Medieval Festivals. The exhibition is closed April 29 and May 26 for two concerts and on July 4.  While there is no charge to view "A Window to the Soul," donations are accepted and access is included in tour and event admission.]]></perf_description>

<perf_name><![CDATA[The Secret Cinema: Musical Cartoons]]></perf_name>
<perf_description><![CDATA[Two of the Secret Cinema's favorite types of films to show are musical shorts and cartoons. Yet, the two genres have a lengthy, deep and harmonious (sorry!) history together, beginning in the earliest days of sound animation. Both Walt Disney's "Steamboat Willie" and Max Fleischer's "My Old Kentucky Home" used popular music as a central theme. The latter film was from Fleischer's "Song Car-Tunes" series, and featured bouncing ball lyrics, an innovation patented by Max. Many sound cartoons from the 1930s featured a non-stop soundtrack of hot jazz or other pop music of its time, with the animated portion of a theater's selected short subjects serving as the MTV of its time. Other cartoons made music part of their plots, or featured caricatures and even live-action appearances of famous singers and musicians. Tonight, Secret Cinema will be screening a variety of cartoons from several of the top animation studios of the classic era, from the 1920s through the 1950s (and perhaps a few examples from the post-classic era). All feature music or musicians, including jazz, swing, and opera (!), on the soundtracks and in story lines. As usual, this Secret Cinema program will be projected in 16mm film on a giant screen (not video).]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[On Sunday, April 29, at 9:00 a.m. at Ridley Creek State Park in Media, runners and walkers dressed in superhero costumes will gather in support of CASA Youth Advocates, a Media, PA-based organization whose mission is to champion children in Delaware and Chester counties' child welfare systems. CASA Youth Advocates recruits, trains, and supports volunteer Court Appointed Special Advocates who work to ensure that abused and neglected children in Delaware and Chester Counties' child welfare systems find a safe, permanent, and nurturing home. CASA served 206 of our region's vulnerable children in 2017, nearly doubling the number of cases served in the last ten years, yet that is still less than 20% of the children who could benefit from the support of a CASA volunteer. That's where fundraising events like the 3rd Annual Superhero 5K Run and Walk play an important role.  Emmy Award winning FOX29 News Reporter Chris O'Connell will join us again during this year's festivities to help us kick-off the start of the race. He adds, "CASA Youth Advocates does some amazing work. They are the unsung heroes to our most vulnerable children."  Each 5K registrant receives a t-shirt, refreshments, water stations, and prizes. The event includes awards for the top overall male and female race finishers, overall age group winners, best costume (for both humans and pets) and top sponsors. Timing and logistics will be coordinated by Bryn Mawr Racing Company. Awards: Top overall male/female race finishers, overall age group winners, best  costume (for both humans and pets) and top 1-3 sponsors.]]></perf_description>

In case of inclement weather, the celebration will be moved inside to the 2nd floor of the Smith Mansion Playhouse. It's fun, free and everyone is invited! No experience necessary. Special guests will be on-hand to open our celebration with a welcome speech. This will be followed by a 1-hour Laughter Yoga exercise session, co-hosted by Laughter Yoga Teachers Alexa Drubay and Bill Powell (Philadelphia Parks and Recreation Performing Arts Coordinator). Other area Laughter Yoga professionals will also be present to help lead the session. We will end with a mindfulness meditation focusing on world peace, which will be guided by Philadelphia Yoga legend Jennifer Schelter. World Laughter Day (WLD) is celebrated the first Sunday in May all over the world. This annual celebration was created in 1998 by cardiologist Dr. Madan Kataria, who also founded the internationally acclaimed Laughter Yoga movement in 1995. Today, and in its 23rd year, Laughter Yoga is practiced in 108 countries and at over 6000 laughter clubs. Look out for WLD events being celebrated in Paris, Tokyo, Sydney, Toronto, Berlin, Frankfurt, Taipei, Rome, Hong Kong, and other cities.  The celebration of World Laughter Day is a positive manifestation for world peace and is intended to build up a global consciousness of unity and friendship through laughter.  Philadelphia participants will be able to pick up Laughter Yoga health and resilience packets, as well as area laughter club listings at our info booth. Local sponsors will also provide snacks and water.  Thanks to Smith Memorial Playground, Repatriation Group International, the Delaware County Parks and Recreation and local businesses, for supporting our event.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[This year Pinnacle Parkour Academy will be offering not one but three Summer camp weeks to choose from. Early Bird pricing starting at $250/week. Camp pricing will go up $50 every month for their respective weeks starting on the following days: Week 1 - $350 until 4/25; Week 2 - $300 until 4/23; Week 3 - $250 until 4/27. The curriculum for Summer Camp 2018 is based on Ukemi - the Discipline of Falling.    Failure is an essential element of any learning process and the movement art of failure is known as Ukemi. Ukemi is a Japanese word that means "breaking ones fall" and is used to describe a method of falling without getting injured. The method originated in martial art styles including judo, aikido, jujitsu, and wushu and has since been translated over to other sports including parkour. Ukemi was designed to study falling techniques related to specific scenarios of a specific sport. In aikido, ukemi is used to practice falling out of "uncontrolled" throws safely. A similar example in parkour ukemi, would be failing a front flip and instead of landing on your head, you turn it into a dive roll. Failing is a part of every sport and learning how to fail safely is one of the most important skills that we can learn as athletes.  Summer Camp will run from 9 AM - 3 PM, Monday through Friday. We will be providing lunch for the kids each day, and they are free to bring whatever extra snacks they wish. We are asking that everyone bring a water bottle, and wear athletic clothing and sneakers. (Absolutely no flip-flops, sandals, or crocs)]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Exhibition Dates: April 4-29.  First Friday:  April 6, 5-9.  Reception: Sunday April 8, 12-4.  Gallery Hours: Wednesday-Sunday 12-5PM. Conny Parsons presents a series of large oil paintings that are visually or physically split.  Parsons references objects in and aspects of nature such as stones, earth, wind, air and water.  Like or dissimilar natural objects are shifted or joined into a whole that is greater than the components. Like objects are repeated, reversed or misplaced. Dissimilar images are joined in a cohesive way through color, shapes, movement, transparency, and repetition. This series is about the continual change in the primitive, natural world.  The artist allowed imagery to happen as she painted and playfully terms the resulting series as "Organized Chaos".]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Exhibition Dates: April 4-29.  First Friday:  April 6, 5-9.  Reception: Sunday April 8, 12-4.  Gallery Hours: Wednesday-Sunday 12-5PM. Alleger's work incorporates her travels and she has begun a series of projects entitled Wanderlust for each locale that she visits. She asks herself "What happens when I step out of my daily routine and step into the unknown?" Travel allows her the opportunity to slow down and observe a new culture and speculate about daily life there.  Her newest series Wanderlust: Iceland is a yearlong reflection of how a once sleepy little village has been flooded by visitors. She embraces the beauty of the landscape and quaint homes, while grappling with the impact tourism has had on the country. While speculating on daily life in Reykjavik, the capital and largest city, she was confronted with the realization that the entire city was consumed with the tourism industry. Its cultural identity was being over shadowed by a need to cater to its visitors.  Development brought benefits but also negatives like rising costs and need to maintain new infrastructure. What will happen if and when this bubble bursts? Jasmine Alleger has a MFA in Studio Art, 2013 from Moore College of Art and Design, Philadelphia, PA and a BS in Drawing and Painting, 2010 from Portland State University Portland, OR.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[A special concert presentation expanded with historic imagery and descriptive discourse, with piano, violin and cello. Music: E.T.A. Hoffmann: Grand Piano Trio in E Major; Beethoven: Piano Sonata in E major, op. 109; Brahms: Piano Trio #1 in B major, Schumann: Adagio and Allegro for cello and piano.  We jump back to the dawn of the 19th century and visit a fascinating series of connections around the explosion of musical romanticism in "Beethoven to Brahms," framed with notions about artistic spirit in art and music.This will be highlighted through the lens of the unique writer E.T.A. Hoffmann (who wrote "The Nutcracker" and other fantastical tales), a man who deeply loved music and wanted to be a professional composer.  Great music within an expanded lecture + visual presentation, this concert will be a glorious sharing of splendid works in which to immerse oneself. Two performances, two venues:  5/19, 7:30 p.m. at Ivy Hall - International Institute for Culture and 5/20, 3 p.m, Ethical Society Building.

<perf_description><![CDATA[Tibetan artist and Buddhist meditation teacher Losang Samten returns to PFP for his annual residency, creating an image of the universe in colored sand over the course of a week. The public is invited to stop by to observe, and to speak with Losang about the stories and messages embedded in this art of Tibet, his homeland. This year, Losang is bringing the Mandala of Compassion to life in our gallery through his meditative and breathtaking process.  "Mandalas are healing for an individual's body, speech, mind and the environment," Losang explains.   The Mandala of Compassion features the Buddha of Compassion whose name, Chenrezig, means unconditional love to all beings. In response to messages, acts and policies of hatred and greed in our contemporary world -- messages, acts and policies that endanger individuals, families and communities -- we at the Philadelphia Folklore Project asked Losang to create this particular design. The nurturing of compassion is one potent way to counter these assaults on dignity and safety. Dismantling: on Friday, April 27, Losang will preside over a dismantling ceremony beginning at 6:00 pm during which the mandala is ritually swept into a vase. The sand is then returned to nature.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[What: The 4th Annual Overdose Awareness Day and Memorial Walk will be held to raise awareness and remember those lives lost to addiction in our community.    Who: The Bridge to Recovery Foundation is a non-profit organization started by Christine Cocker and Valerie Schina. This foundation aims to raise awareness, provide education and advocacy surrounding the disease of addiction and overdose deaths in the community. The foundation offers support and resources to individuals seeking recovery from an addiction to substances and to their families and loved ones.  Through fundraising and donations received, the foundation provides financial assistance so that people can be successful on their journey to  long-term recovery.    All proceeds from the walk will be used to financially assist those starting or continuing on their recovery journey with scholarships.    Info: Last year, over 5,000 people attended and an even bigger number of attendees is expected this year. The audience at this event will consist of community members who have lost loved ones to addiction, who are currently struggling with addiction, and local addiction service providers as well as community leaders and local law enforcement invested in educating our community on this serious issue.    This is a family friendly event. There will also be a collection of trial size toiletries or a donation of $5 for the purchase of items needed for the homeless population.

The theme of this art show follows from these ideas.    The first home in America of artist and naturalist John James Audubon, the John James Audubon Center encompasses environmental education, an art collection and historic structures on 175 acres of rolling hills, fields and forest along the Perkiomen Creek.     Come visit to see this beautiful show in the historic barn from April 14 to April 28, 2018. The show is free to attend during the listed hours and represents the work of more than 150 artists.

This performance features the Sanctuary Choir, Singing for Life, Youth Chorale, and Children's Choir, along with jazz musicians, a haunting audio soundtrack of animal-song superimposed over the singing of the choir, and a dazzling video that will be projected above the choir.

<perf_description><![CDATA[Join us for an illustrated Weeknights at the Wagner lecture to learn about a project that melds photographic innovation, high-tech lab equipment, creative arts, and historical investigation. Sometime around 1850, photographer Frederick Langenheim traveled from Philadelphia to New York and made two photographs. He later reduced those images to the size of a pin-head and preserved them on microscopic slides, which are now part of the Wagner's historic collections.  Too small to decipher with the naked eye, the contents of the Wagner's two microphotographs were unknown until last year. Artists Byron Wolfe and Daniel Seth Kraus teamed up to solve the mystery of these images. Their research took them through hi-tech labs, historical archives, and the streets of New York. They discovered that the slides contained two of the earliest photographic images of Manhattan and Staten Island. At "Tiny Mysteries: Decoding the Wagner's 19th-Century Microphotographs," Wolfe and Kraus will share the images, their turbulent historical context, and the questions and creative work they have inspired. This research was supported through a 2017 Temple-Wagner Humanities & Arts Research Fellowship. The Wagner's exhibition hall will remain open past its usual 4 p.m. closing time until 6 p.m., when the lecture begins.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[Ian is an offbeat yet upbeat stand up comic, writer, and actor from Wilmington, Delaware who calls New York City his home; Brooklyn to be specific, but you can already tell by his mustache. A delicious cup of tea best drank live, his comedy has been described as "bizarre yet funny" by The Interrobang. A popular guest on both SiriusXM radio's "The Bennington Show" and the Artie Lange & Anthony Cumia Show. He's been featured in the Eugene Mirman Comedy Festival, as well as the Boston, Brooklyn, and New York Comedy Festivals. He's written & performed in sketches for Above Average, Conde Nast, and Funny or Die, and was commissioned by Nike to write & star in a live media presentation for their "Hyper" line of athletic wear.   Fidance made his stand up TV debut on the third season of AXS TV's "Gotham Comedy Live," can be seen on the upcoming season of "Talk 30 to Me" on VH1, and was recently featured on Late Night with Seth Meyers. After working a million jobs while growing up an only child to a single mother in Delaware, Ian has grown to be a live force and a stand out stand up with a fresh, positive voice in comedy. He can be seen nightly riding his bike(cycle) everywhere sharing his unique point of view and wild stories at places like New York Comedy Club, The Stand, UCB Theatre, the Creek & the Cave, Union Hall, and The Bell House. Every month he hosts a live stand up & animation show called "Picture This!" at Union Hall in Brooklyn. He'll hit the road often playing clubs, colleges, and independent venues all across the country, but will usually use his car for that.  Come see Ian and some of Philly's best standup comedians at the chillest venue in town.]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA["A House Divided", book, music and lyrics by Michael J. Salmanson, Maureen Kane Berg and Thomas C. Berg, focuses on the personal side of the Lincolns, set against the backdrop of the Civil War.  Using a mix of original music true to the period, as well as songs from the era, the show faithfully portrays critical moments in the Lincoln's lives.  Using Lincoln's own words including his greatest speeches, while also drawing on his less well-known intimate and humorous sides, the play presents a personal and poignant portrait of the Lincolns and those closest to them. From the family's departure for Washington from their beloved Springfield, to the moment of assassination, A House Divided explores the intense personal and psychological struggles Mary and Abraham Lincoln face against the backdrop of war and politics. This fully staged world premiere by Narberth Community Theater represents the culmination of several years of development under the auspices of the New Musical Theater Exchange in Minneapolis.  NMTE sponsored three staged readings of the work; the play then was selected for a series of staged readings by the Bluegrass Opera Company in Mary Lincoln's hometown of Lexington, Kentucky.  The cast of Narberth Community Theatre's "A House Divided" includes a talented ensemble featuring Danny Seifert, Megan Keiser, Christopher Betzler, Kai Sherman, Sam Heft, Blessing Osazuwa, Randall Frame, John Cochrane, Jr., Gabriella Grosso, Mark Urmson, Muneera Walker, Gary Bullock, Sally Foster-Chang, Lisa Franks, Melanie Jones, William McVail, Andrea Ogle, Rich Pogolowitz, Dakota Seifert, Quintin Seifert, River Seifert and Moss Stern]]></perf_description>

<perf_description><![CDATA[The Phillips' Mill Photographic Exhibition is seeking entries for its 26th  annual competition and has selected a panel of jurors to choose the images - and prize winners - for the show scheduled for June 2-24 at the 1756 grist mill just outside New Hope, Pa.    The exhibition's theme since the first exhibition has remained, "Photography as Art" and "Photographer as Artist." Photographers are encouraged to submit a current body of work created within the past five years. Images may be in any photographic medium, from historic to alternative and digital, in order to best represent the artist's creative expression.   The exhibition draws entries from hobbyists, as well as professional artists from throughout the country and, in some years, from around the globe. More than half a dozen financial awards are presented, including a prize for "Best of Show."    Entries may be shipped by May 8 to PMPE Entries, 358 Cafferty Road, Pipersville Pa., 18947. Submissions may also be hand-delivered to Phillips' Mill Community Association, 2619 River Road, New Hope on May 11 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on May 12. There is no limit to the number of submissions.   Entry fee is $42 for up to four images; $10 for each additional image submitted. PMPE also accepts matted and covered images for non-juried portfolio bins. Up to four images can be submitted free of charge. The fee is $10 for each additional image. All work submitted for the exhibition must be available for sale.  Following submission dates, jurors will review the pool of several hundred images and pare it down to about 150 images. This year's jurors are past Phillips' Mill Photographic Exhibition award-winning photographers Wendy Brusca, Valerie Pfaff and Henry Rowan.]]></perf_description>
